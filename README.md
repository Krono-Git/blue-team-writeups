# blue-team-writeups
A collection of blue team cybersecurity challenge writeups focused on defensive techniques, log analysis, SIEM investigations, and incident response. Includes hands-on labs from platforms like TryHackMe and other SOC-level scenarios.

These writeups are my personal notes and documentation from solving various blue team cybersecurity challenge rooms and simulations. They are intended for educational and reference purposes only.

I do not recommend visiting any external links, domains, or IP addresses that appear in screenshots or text they may be malicious or simulated for training environments only.

These writeups are not intended as professional cybersecurity advice, guidance, or recommendations.

All content is based on my own learning experience from platforms like TryHackMe or other lab environments.

Use this repository at your own discretion and always follow safe cybersecurity practices.
